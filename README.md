# The-Don-of-Creations-

## User Story

Users location of previous work from link

User finds developers name, photo, work, and means to email them

Functional navigation links

Responsive Layout of picture using 100% width technique 

Email and resume link functional

### Cons
Portfolio navigation not smooth after clicking resume and previous work links, 
( Have to click the arrow to go back located at the top left of the webpage)

Issue with sending footer down to fixed position

Started off with a color scheme that did not fit
Changed the background picture to a color due to words blending in the image

UI scrolls not operational with smooth scroll link

still not certain where I was going with the section id under an addtional main section, One of the youtube videos must have mentioned to do that and I made an effort to add that in to the code.
